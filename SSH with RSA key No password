If we have private and public RSA key, then no need to put password while doing ssh to other server, We just need to do following things,

1) Generate Private and Public key (key pair) 
  
  Command : $ ssh-keygen -N  "" -q -f /home/testuser/.ssh/id_rsa 
  After executing above commad to files will be generated
  a)id_rsa //private key, need to be kept in server from where want to do ssh
  b)id_rsa.pub //public key, need to be move where want to go by ssh
  
2) We have to move public key to remote server where we want to do ssh. 
  There are 2 way to do this  
  
  a) $ ssh-copy-id -i /home/testuser/.ssh/id_rsa.pub root@[ip]
    This will ask you a password of a server for coping a public RSA key and rest configuration done in /root/.ssh/authorized_keys file automatically.
  
  b) Copy public key using scp or cp command then configuration by cat command.
    
	b.1) scp /home/testuser/.ssh/id_rsa.pub root@[ip]
    b.2) Add RSA key in /root/.ssh/authorized_keys file.
	     $ cat /root/id_rsa.pub >>~/.ssh/authorized_keys;chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
