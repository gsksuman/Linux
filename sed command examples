When you copy a DOS file to Unix, you could find \r\n in the end of each line. This example converts the DOS file format to Unix file format using sed command.
$sed 's/.$//' filename

Print file content in reverse order
$ sed -n '1!G;h;$p' thegeekstuff.txt

Add line number for all non-empty-lines in a file
$ sed '/./=' thegeekstuff.txt | sed 'N; s/\n/ /'

sed -i 's/foo/bar/g' *
Occurrences of "foo" will be replaced with "bar".
