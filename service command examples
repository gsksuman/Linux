Service command is used to run the system V init scripts. i.e Instead of calling the scripts located in the /etc/init.d/ directory with their full path, you can use the service command.

Check the status of a service:
# service ssh status

Check the status of all the services.
# service --status-all

Restart a service.
# service ssh restart
